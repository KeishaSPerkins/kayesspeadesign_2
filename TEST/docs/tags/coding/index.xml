      <description>I spoke at Baton Rouge Hack Night about my favorite static site generator, HUGO.
 Hugo is a great static site generator that&#39;s super fast and lightweight. This talk demos the steps for getting a site up and running, adding a few posts, and choosing a theme. I really recommend digging into the HUGO docs as well as the HUGO Community Forum for more in-depth explanations of how to use HUGO for your own site.</description>

      <description>This talk is about using JavaScript to create games on the HTML5 canvas. Though you won’t create the next Halo, you’ll learn so much about JavaScript and programming as a whole when you create games with it. In this talk, I’ll introduce you to a library that’s perfect for beginners and “non-coders” alike called p5.js.
Why JavaScript? JavaScript is everywhere. If you use the internet, you’ve almost certainly encountered JavaScript.</description>

      <description>I developed this workshop for La&amp;#8209;WIT annual IT Girls program. The workshop was meant to introduce area middle school girls to JavaScript using the p5.js library.
The workshop has a workbook as well as an accompanying website. By the workbook&amp;rsquo;s end, you&amp;rsquo;ll have built a working game with JavaScript!</description>
