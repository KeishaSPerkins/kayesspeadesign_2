When you hear the word _rebrand_, what do you think of? Do you think of tweaking a line here and a dot there on a company logo? Maybe it's polishing up a company's logo and website for a fresh new look? Or maybe what comes to mind is a full overhaul, complete with totally new imagery and name change.

All three of these fall somewhere in the spectrum of what companies and agencies have done over the years to have customers see them anew. In this article we'll detail each of these levels of "rebrand"--refresh, reboot, and rebuild--and why they may be right for your business.

# What is a Brand Refresh?

The first level of rebrand we'll talk about is a _refresh_. This level of rebrand is most suitable for a company with relatively simple needs. A major candidate for refreshes are companies that began small, but need new tools and identity to show customers that they can be taken seriously. Maybe that website your nephew put together has taken you this far, but it's time show the world you mean business!

Refreshes usually include elements like:

* Research to discover the company's future needs
* Visual Brand Identity
* Website
* Copywriting
* Photography
* Company Stationary

The purpose of a refresh is to get your brand's public presentation and image to match where your brand is going not only at the moment, but in the future.

During the refresh, things to consider are what each of these components needs to do. For instance, does your website need to allow customers to buy goods from you? Or would a simple one-page informational site work best? Keeping in mind your goals for each element of your company's identity will help you ensure that your efforts--and money spent--aren't in vain.

# What is a Brand Reboot?

This next level of rebrand, the _reboot_ is often right for companies that need help managing the issues that come with growth. Perhaps you've got a small operation that's quickly becoming a mid-sized company. Maybe your employees need more effective internal communication or your company could stand to distance itself from a few bad associations. If you can relate to outgrowing your company's current station, consider a reboot.

Reboots usually include elements like:

* An audit of the company's brand at its current state
* Research to discover the company's future needs
* Strategy for branding and marketing
* Visual Brand Identity
* Website design
* Company Stationary
* Marketing materials
* Copywriting
* Photography

One major difference between a refresh and a reboot is the amount of research that will be necessary to assess where your company stands and what needs to be done to get it where it needs to be. 

You'll need to get a handle on what your customers are already saying about the company and what you _want_ them to be saying about the company. Information like where your business fits into the competitive landscape and how purposeful positioning can give you the edge you need to sustain growth will be important aspects of your company's research results.

# What is a Brand Rebuild?

A brand _rebuild_ is a complete overhaul, necessary for brands with complex structures and many moving parts that need to be managed with care. Companies with international markets or business that are restructuring to include subsidiaries need to extensive effort that a rebuild can bring.

* An audit of the company's brand at its current state
* Research to discover the company's future needs
* Brand architecture
* Strategy for branding and marketing
* Strategy for brand rollout and presentation
* Visual brand identity
* Visual identity guidelines and structure
* Website design
* Company Stationary
* Marketing materials
* Copywriting
* Photography

A interesting aspect of the rebuild is the development of a _brand architecture_ or a structure for how all the parts of your brand work individually and collectively. Perhaps your company began as a carpet manufacturer, but has branched out to include furniture factories and premium paints. Your rebuilt brand may need a complete restructuring that lets all three of these core markets have well-organized representation.

For companies that need to make fundamental shifts in the way the business function and is perceived to function, a rebuild will help align customer understanding and company operations.

# Conclusion

No two companies will have the exact same branding needs. It's important to keep your company's current state, as well has goals for the future in mind when deciding what rebrand strategy is best. A rebrand on any level will require an amount of risk and capital from your business, so take your time in choosing a company that will be suited to your company's needs.
