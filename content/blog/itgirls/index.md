<p>I developed this workshop for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.la-wit.org">La&#8209;WIT</a> annual IT Girls program. The workshop was meant to introduce area middle school girls to JavaScript using the <a target="_blank" href="http://p5js.org">p5.js</a> library.</p>

<p>The workshop has a {{< resource url="booklet.pdf" target="_blank" text="workbook" >}} as well as an <a target='_blank' href="https://la-wit.github.io/build-an-infinite-runner/">accompanying website</a>. By the workbook's end, you'll have built a working game with JavaScript!</p>
